# Contribution Guidelines

Most of the API's functionality comes from WeaverFi's SDK. That repository can be found [here](https://github.com/CookieTrack-io/weaverfi).

If you'd like to contribute to something specific with regards to the API, feel free to create a new issue, PR, or get in touch with other contributors through our [Discord server](https://discord.com/invite/DzADcq7y75).

## Reporting Bugs

Found a bug? You can either choose to report it in our [Discord server](https://discord.com/invite/DzADcq7y75) in the #bug-reports channel, or by creating an issue on this repository. To do so, go to `Issues`, `New Issue`, and you'll see a template for bug reports to facilitate your report.
